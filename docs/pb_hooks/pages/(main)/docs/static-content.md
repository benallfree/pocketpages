# Serving Static Content in PocketPages

In PocketPages, serving static content is straightforward and integrated seamlessly into the framework. Any file that isn't an EJS template (`*.ejs`), doesn't begin with a `+`, and isn't in a `_private` directory is treated as a static file. These files are served directly by the underlying Echo framework, which handles content type inference, streaming, and other necessary details.

## What is Considered Static Content?

Static content refers to files that are served directly to the client without server-side processing or dynamic generation. These files typically include:

- HTML files (`*.html`)
- CSS files (`*.css`)
- JavaScript files (`*.js`)
- Image files (`*.jpg`, `*.png`, etc.)
- Font files (`*.woff`, `*.ttf`, etc.)
- Other binary files or documents (e.g., PDFs, videos)

For dynamic asset handling in your templates and pages, PocketPages provides the `asset()` function that helps generate correct URLs for your static assets. This function ensures your assets are properly referenced regardless of your application's base path configuration.

For more details on managing and organizing your static assets effectively, see the [Asset Management Guide](/docs/guides/asset-management).
