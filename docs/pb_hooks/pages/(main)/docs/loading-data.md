# Loading Data in PocketPages

PocketPages provides a robust mechanism to load data dynamically before rendering your EJS templates using a special `+load.js` file. This file, when placed at any directory level, will be executed before any EJS template in that directory is rendered. Below, we'll explore how to use `+load.js`, demonstrate the module structure, and explain the execution flow with examples.

## The `+load.js` File

### Purpose

The `+load.js` file is designed to load or compute data that your EJS templates might need. The data returned by the loader function in `+load.js` will be made available to your EJS templates through the `data` property in the request context.

### Structure of `+load.js`

The `+load.js` file must use `module.exports` to export a loader function. This function will receive the request context as an argument and should return an object containing the data you wish to pass to the template.

You can use JSDoc to reference the `PageDataLoaderFunc` type for better IDE support and type checking:

```javascript
/** @type {import('pocketpages').PageDataLoaderFunc} */
module.exports = function (context) {
  // Perform data loading operations here
  const productId = context.params.productId

  // Example: Fetch product details from a database
  const productDetails = getProductDetails(productId)

  // Return an object containing the data
  return {
    product: productDetails,
  }
}
```

### Example `+load.js` File

```javascript
module.exports = function (context) {
  // Perform data loading operations here
  const productId = context.params.productId

  // Example: Fetch product details from a database
  const productDetails = getProductDetails(productId)

  // Return an object containing the data
  return {
    product: productDetails,
  }
}
```

### How It Works

- **Execution**: When a request matches a route level with a `+load.js` file, the loader function in that file is executed.
- **Data Availability**: The returned object from the loader function is attached to the request context as `data`, making it accessible in the EJS templates.

## Example Scenario with Multiple `+load.js` Files

Consider the following directory structure:

```
pb_hooks/pages/
   +load.js
   index.ejs
   about/
      +load.js
      index.ejs
   products/
      +load.js
      [productId]/
         +load.js
         index.ejs
         details.ejs
   contact.ejs
```

### Loader Execution Scenarios

1. **Root Level Request (`/`)**:

   - **Files Involved**: `pb_hooks/pages/+load.js`, `pb_hooks/pages/index.ejs`
   - **Loader Executed**: The loader in `pages/+load.js` will execute when accessing the root URL (`/`). The data returned by this loader will be available in `pages/index.ejs`.

2. **About Page Request (`/about`)**:

   - **Files Involved**: `pb_hooks/pages/about/+load.js`, `pb_hooks/pages/about/index.ejs`
   - **Loader Executed**: The loader in `pages/about/+load.js` will execute when accessing `/about`. The data returned will be available in `about/index.ejs`.

3. **Products Page Request (`/products`)**:

   - **Files Involved**: `pb_hooks/pages/products/+load.js`, `pb_hooks/pages/products/index.ejs`
   - **Loader Executed**: The loader in `pages/products/+load.js` will execute when accessing `/products`. The data returned will be available in `products/index.ejs`.

4. **Product Details Request (`/products/123`)**:

   - **Files Involved**: `pb_hooks/pages/products/[productId]/+load.js`, `pb_hooks/pages/products/[productId]/index.ejs`
   - **Loader Executed**: The loader in `pages/products/[productId]/+load.js` will execute when accessing `/products/123`. The data returned will be available in `products/[productId]/index.ejs`.

5. **Product Details Specific Page (`/products/123/details`)**:

   - **Files Involved**: `pb_hooks/pages/products/[productId]/+load.js`, `pb_hooks/pages/products/[productId]/details.ejs`
   - **Loader Executed**: The same loader in `pages/products/[productId]/+load.js` will execute for both `index.ejs` and `details.ejs` under `[productId]`. Therefore, when accessing `/products/123/details`, this loader will still be executed, and its data will be available in `details.ejs`.

6. **Contact Page Request (`/contact`)**:
   - **Files Involved**: `pb_hooks/pages/contact.ejs`
   - **Loader Executed**: No loader is executed because there is no `+load.js` file in the `pages/` directory that directly corresponds to the `contact.ejs` file. The template will render without additional data loading.

### Key Points to Remember

- **Isolated Loaders**: Loaders in isolated directories (like `pages/about/+load.js`) only execute for requests that match the route corresponding to that directory (`/about` in this case).
- **Multiple EJS Files**: If you have multiple EJS files at the same directory level (like `index.ejs` and `details.ejs` in `products/[productId]/`), the same loader (`+load.js`) will be executed for any request that matches that directory.
- **No Loader Execution**: If there is no `+load.js` at the specific route level, no data loading will occur, and the EJS template will render as usual.
